    <h1>Moving the attribution text</h1>
    <p>
      As we now have the OverviewMap unfolded by default
      the attribution text is partly hidden by the overview map.
    </p>
    <p>
      To change this we need to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Disable the use of a theme in the map object</li>
      <li>Load the default themes <b>style.css</b> file explictly ourselves</li>
      <li>Define our own style for the <b>.olControlAttribution</b> class</li>
    </ul>
  </body>
