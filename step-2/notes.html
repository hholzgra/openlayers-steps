  <p>Now we zoom in on a certain position.</p>
  <p>
    We usually have latitude/longitude coordinates as input
    (WGS 1984, projection name ""EPSG:4326")
    but need to transfer these to the spherical mercator
    projection (projection name "EPSG:900913")
    used by the OpenStreetMap and GoogleMaps map tiles.
  </p>
  <p>
    Don't wonder about these projection names too much,
    the two used here will probably be the only ones
    you'll ever need.
